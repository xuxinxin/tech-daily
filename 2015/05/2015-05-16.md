## ES6 In Depth: Generators
  * introduction to generators:
  ```javascript
  function* quips(name) {
	  yield "hello " + name + "!";
	  yield "i hope you are enjoying the blog posts";
	  if (name.startsWith("X")) {
	    yield "it's cool how your name starts with X, " + name;
	  }
	  yield "see you later!";
	}
	```
	This is called Generator function. Two difference with function:
	  1. Generator-function start with function*
	  2. instead of `return`, Generator-function `yield` any number of times
  
  * When you call the `quips()`, it will return an iterator.Then you call iterator.next()method,the function call thaws itself out and runs until it reaches the next yield expression. And paused.

  * Generators are not threads.

  * Generator-function return an iterator, canbe used *Refactoring complex loops* & *Tools for working with iterables.*

  * Generators with promise to produce async code.
