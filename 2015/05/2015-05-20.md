## [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com)

Handlebars is a JavaScript library that allows you to render complex HTML templates and
insert them into the DOM.Handlebars provides the power necessary to let you build semantic templates effectively with no frustration.

## Why handlebars？
* Suppose we wantto insert two tags into the DOM, we probably execute the fllowing code:
	```Javascript
	var body = document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0];
	body.innerHTML = '<h3>' + subject + '</h3>' +
	'<p>' + question + '</p>';
	```
  This is quite ugly,dectroying the separation of markup and interaction logic.
* Rather than representing HTML as raw strings diretly within JavaScript, it places the HTML we'd like to insert with JavaScript within our HTML file.
	```Javascript
	<script type="text/x‐handlebars‐template" id="question‐template">
	<h3>{{ subject }}</h3>
	<p>{{ question }}</p>
	</script>
    ```
