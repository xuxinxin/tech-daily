## localStorage

The JavaScript localStorage API provides key-value pair storage. Any key-value pairs stored in localStorage are persistent, meaning that they will still be present even after the browser is refreshed or the user navigates away from the page.

* `localStorage.setItem(key, value)` or `localStorage.key = value`
* `localStorage.getItem(key)` or `localStorage.key` : Returns the value

When you test this in IE, you should note **It doesn't work in file://, while it work in http://.** So remember set a server!
